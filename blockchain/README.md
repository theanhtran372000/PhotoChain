# PhotoChain Smart Contracts

### Deployment tips

1. Re-deploy contracts to Goerli testnet:

```
cd blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

2. After deploying, the address will be showned on the terminal. Copy that and use it for your Web 3 application.

3. In case you don't want to re-deploy, here is the address of the deployed smart contract

```
// License contract
0x0ABDe1485A08De10C22D26f85a96cc64FBE4ba5b

// Executor contract
0x245A09244882913A8fB67967A44AD6B88Cc369D2
```
